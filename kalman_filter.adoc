# Kalman filter 

(With help from Github Copilot and the Kalman filter Wikipedia page)


The Kalman filter is an algorithm that uses a series of measurements observed over time to estimate the state of a system. It is particularly useful for tracking the state of a system that is subject to noise and uncertainty. The Kalman filter is widely used in a variety of applications, including navigation, robotics, and signal processing.

The Kalman filter works by combining two sources of information: predictions from a mathematical model of the system and measurements from sensors. The filter uses these predictions and measurements to estimate the state of the system and to update its estimate as new measurements become available.

The Kalman filter is based on a set of mathematical equations that describe the evolution of the system over time. These equations include a process model that describes how the system's state changes over time and a measurement model that describes how the sensors provide measurements of the system's state.

The Kalman filter is an optimal estimator in the sense that it minimizes the mean squared error of the estimate. This means that the Kalman filter provides the best possible estimate of the system's state given the available measurements and the uncertainty in the system.

The Kalman filter is a recursive algorithm, meaning that it can update its estimate of the system's state as new measurements become available. This makes the Kalman filter well-suited for real-time applications where new measurements are continuously being received.

## Parameter values for the Kalman filter
To determine the values for the Kalman filter parameters (`processNoise`, `measurementNoise`, `estimationError`, and `initialValue`), you typically need to consider the specific application and the characteristics of the system you are modeling. Here are some general guidelines:

### 1 **Process Noise (`processNoise`)**: 

This parameter represents the uncertainty in the process model. If the system dynamics are well understood and predictable, this value can be small. If there is a lot of uncertainty or variability in the system, this value should be larger.

### 2. **Measurement Noise (`measurementNoise`)**: 
This parameter represents the uncertainty in the measurements. If the sensor providing the measurements is very accurate, this value can be small. If the sensor is noisy or unreliable, this value should be larger.

### 3. **Estimation Error (`estimationError`)**: 

This parameter represents the initial uncertainty in the estimate. If you have a good initial estimate, this value can be small. If the initial estimate is uncertain, this value should be larger.

### 4. **Initial Value (`initialValue`)**: 

This parameter represents the initial estimate of the state. This should be based on any prior knowledge you have about the system's state at the start.


## The GY-521 module 

which contains the MPU-6050 sensor, is commonly used for measuring acceleration and gyroscopic data. The measurement noise values for such sensors can vary, but typical values for the MPU-6050 are as follows:

### Accelerometer Noise: 
The noise level for the accelerometer is typically around 0.002 g/√Hz.

### Gyroscope Noise: 

The noise level for the gyroscope is typically around 0.03 °/s/√Hz.

These values can be used to estimate the measurement noise for your Kalman filter. However, the exact values may depend on your specific application and environment. Here is an example of how you might initialize the Kalman filter with these values:

 // Hypothetical values for the Kalman filter parameters for GY-521
    float processNoise = 1.0f; // This value may need to be tuned based on your application
    float measurementNoiseAccel = 0.002f; // Accelerometer noise
    float measurementNoiseGyro = 0.03f; // Gyroscope noise
    float estimationError = 1.0f; // Initial estimation error
    float initialValue = 0.0f; // Initial value of the state
